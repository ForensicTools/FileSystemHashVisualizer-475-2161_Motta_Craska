Programming Strategy

Authors: Christian Motta and Sean Craska

Language: JavaScript

JavaScript will be used to store each file system object. This object will include a string to store the name
of the FS object, an array to store the hashes of that object, and another array to store children of that object.

Hashing algorithm:

1. User inputs which hashes to use
2. Program starts at head of file system.
3. Program hashes current file, stores results in array of hashes.
4. Program stores children in in child array, stores 0s for all entries if node is a file and not a directory.
5. If no children, return to last node.
6. Last node == root node, go to display function.
7. If children, iterate through array. Repeat steps 3 - 7 until display function reached.

Display algortihm:

1. Start at root node.
2. If child array not all 0s, display node structure.
3. Else, diplsay leaf structure, return to previous node.
# Each displayed structure will contain the file/directory name and calculated hashes.
4. If previous node == root node, exit program.
5. For each entry in child array, repeat steps 1 - 5 until program exits.
